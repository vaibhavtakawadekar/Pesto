    <!-- First stanza of the poem -->
    <p>I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br>
    Are you - Nobody - Too?</p>

    <!-- Second stanza of the poem -->
    <p>Then there's a pair of us!<br>
    Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!<br>
    How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br>
    How public - like a Frog -<br>
    To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog!</p>
