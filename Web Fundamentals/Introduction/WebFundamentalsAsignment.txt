Q.1)    What is a protocol stack, and how is it used in web development?
A-      Internet Protocol has different layers and each layer is responsible for specific task,(eg. data encoding, routing, encryption, 
        error handling, signalling etc.) these layers are the 'Protocol stack'.
        The protocol stack consists of Application, Presentation, session, transport, network, data link & physical layer. In web development, 
        the protocol stack primarily revolves around the application layer of the OSI model. The most common protocols used in web development include, HTTP,
        HTTPS, TCP/IP, DNS, FTP etc. 
        HTTP:  data communication in the World Wide Web
        HTTPS: provide a secure connection between the client and the server.
        TCP/IP: Encrypts data for secure transmission, ensuring privacy and security for sensitive information
        DNS: Translates domain names into IP addresses

Q.2)    What are the different types of web servers, and how do they differ in terms of functionality and performance?
        There are different types of server which includes:
        Web server, database server, email server, web proxy server, DNS, FTP, DHCP, NTP, File server,
        cloud server etc.
        Every server has has its core functionality and they are used for storing/hanling specific kind of data.
        Web Server: Serves web pages and responds to HTTP requests from clients, delivering content like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

        Database Server: Stores and manages data, allowing users or applications to retrieve, update, and manipulate data stored in databases.

        Email Server: Manages the sending, receiving, and storage of email messages, handling protocols like SMTP, IMAP, and POP3.

        Web Proxy Server: Acts as an intermediary between clients and web servers, caching and filtering requests to improve performance, security,
        and anonymity.

        DNS (Domain Name System): Translates domain names into IP addresses, facilitating the resolution of human-readable domain names to numerical IP addresses.

        FTP (File Transfer Protocol) Server: Facilitates the transfer of files between clients and servers over a network, providing a standardized 
        way to upload, download, and manage files.

        DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) Server: Automatically assigns IP addresses and network configuration parameters to devices 
        on a network, simplifying network setup and management.

        NTP (Network Time Protocol) Server: Synchronizes the time between devices on a network, ensuring accurate timekeeping for applications and services.

        File Server: Stores and manages files, allowing users to access and share files over a network, typically using protocols like SMB (Server Message Block) or NFS (Network File System).

        Cloud Server: Provides on-demand computing resources and services over the internet, allowing users to deploy and manage virtual servers, storage, and applications remotely.

Q.3)    What is web hosting, and what are the different types of hosting services available for websites?
A-      In web development, hosting refers to the service of storing and making websites accessible on the internet. There are various types of hosting available:
        Shared Hosting: Multiple websites share server resources; ideal for small websites or beginners on a budget.
        VPS Hosting (Virtual Private Server): Offers more resources and control than shared hosting, with a dedicated virtual server for your website; suitable for growing websites.
        Dedicated Hosting: Entire physical server dedicated to your website, offering high performance and customization; best for large, resource-intensive websites.
        Cloud Hosting: Utilizes multiple interconnected servers for scalability and reliability; effective for handling varying traffic levels.
        Managed WordPress Hosting: Hosting provider manages updates, backups, and security for WordPress websites; ideal for content-focused WordPress site owners.
        Reseller Hosting: Purchase hosting resources in bulk, reselling smaller plans to clients or starting your hosting business. Suitable for managing multiple websites for clients.

Q.4)    What is scaling, and why is it important for web applications? How does scaling differ for vertical and horizontal scaling?
A.-     Scaling is the process of increasing a website's capacity to handle more users, traffic, and requests. It is important
        because it helps ensure that the website remains accessible and responsive even during high traffic periods.
        Vertical scaling, or scaling up, involves upgrading the existing server's resources to handle increased traffic without changing 
        the overall infrastructure.

        Horizontal scaling, or scaling out, entails adding more servers to distribute the load across multiple machines, ideal for 
        large-scale websites facing rapid growth and significant traffic increases.

Q.5)    What is SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and how can web developers optimize their websites for better search engine rankings?
A-      SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the process of optimizing a website to improve its visibility and ranking in search engine results pages
        Web developers can optimize their websites for better search engine rankings by conducting keyword research to identify relevant terms, integrating these keywords naturally into content,
        crafting compelling meta tags and descriptions, submitting sitemaps to search engines for efficient crawling and indexing, and using tools like Google and Bing Webmaster Tools to monitor 
        and analyze website performance.
